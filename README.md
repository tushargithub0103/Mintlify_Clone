# Mintlify Landing Page Clone – Frontend UI Recreation

## Overview

This project is a desktop-first static recreation of a modern SaaS documentation platform landing page. It was built as part of a frontend practice assignment to strengthen core web development fundamentals using only HTML and CSS.

The implementation focuses on visual precision, structured layout composition, and clean styling without relying on JavaScript or external frameworks.
